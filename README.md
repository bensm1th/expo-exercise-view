# expo-exercise-view

This is the code for a weightlifting app for the iOS and Android platforms.  It was created using the following tools: react, react-native, redux.

The app will allow users to build a workout routine, enter that workout routine into a calendar, track their workouts in the gym, 
earn reward points for reaching goals, and see statics about their workouts over time.  

The app is currently in production and not ready for use.
